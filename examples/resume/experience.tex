    {Embedded Systems Engineer} % Job title
    {RMI Laser, LLC} % Organization
    {Lafayette, CO} % Location
    {May 2015 - May 2019} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {
            Researched and developed embedded Linux and FPGA framework for high-speed
            marking lasers (fiber and DPSS) with a focus on high throughput and
            repeatibility as well as compatibility with modern IoT/automation infrastructures.
        }
        \item {
            Successfully brought laser prototype into production and to market with many
            units deployed in the field.
        }
        \item {
            Interfaced vision systems and motion control systems with laser systems.
        }
        \item {
            Worked closely with Senior Electrical Engineer to develop prototype hardware
            and resolve issues across board revisions.
        }
        \item {
            Developed laser drivers for legacy products from scratch for Linux and later
            ported to Android (with $Java$ interface).
        }
        \item {
            Developed embedded Linux device to adapt legacy units to be compatible with
            advanced manufacturing systems and modern hardware. Several prominent
            companies depend on this device to flexibly scale manufacturing operations
            across the world.
        }
        \item {
            Engineers electrical systems for custom automated applications.
